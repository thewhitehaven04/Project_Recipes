    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Spatchcocking makes for a bird with super crisp skin and moist meat, in
      about half the time it takes to roast a whole bird.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 (3 1/2) pound whole chickens, wingtips removed</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried tarragon</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>4 teaspoon olive oil</li>
      <li>2 lemons, thinly sliced and seeded</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a large rimmed
          baking sheet with foil.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Place chicken, breast side down, on a work surface. Starting at the
          tail end, cut along both sides of backbone with kitchen shears. Remove
          backbone. Grabbing hold of both sides of the chicken, open it like a
          book. Turn breast side up. Push down on each side of breast with your
          hands until you hear it crack. Flatten chicken and transfer to one
          short end of the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the second
          chicken.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Combine salt, tarragon, paprika, and pepper in a small bowl. Stir in
          oil. Run your fingers under chicken skin and rub tarragon paste under
          skin. Slide lemon slices under skin, in a single layer.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Roast until skin is crisp and an instant-read thermometer inserted
          into thickest part of breast reads 165 degrees F, about 35 minutes.
          Let stand 5 minutes before cutting each chicken into 8 pieces.
